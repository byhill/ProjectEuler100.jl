This repository contains my solutions to the first 100 problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  Hopefully, by making this repository public, someone will find it a valuable resource for learning Julia and learning how to tackle Project Euler problems.  With the exception of problem 100, the solutions in this repository also work well (after a little modification) for [Hackerrank's](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) ongoing Project Euler+ contest.

Due to Project Euler's [policy](https://projecteuler.net/about#publish) on publishing solutions, I will **not** share my solutions to problems past the first 100.

If you would like to see my current progress on Project Euler, such as what problems I've completed, what awards I've obtained, or my forum posts, feel free to add me as a friend on Project Euler.
